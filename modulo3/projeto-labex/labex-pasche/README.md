# LabeX
This is a webpage where the customer can apply for premade trips around the Milky Way. The application expects two kinds of users: the customer and the employee, wich is the one who registers and deletes available trips.

# Design system
For the visual identity of the application, we took in consideration colors that wont bother the user and also brings feelings relatable to the emotions that a space traveler may experience, like excitement,  goosebumps etc. Here's the palette: (https://coolors.co/6e44ff-b892ff-ffc2e2-ff90b3-ef7a85). For styling the components, the chosen libs were **styled-components** (https://styled-components.com/) and **Material UI** (https://mui.com/). The application prototype (SVG or PDF) can be found at the "wireframe" folder. 

# The application flow and layout
I wanted to make it intuitive, simple and comfortable for the user, not only by choosing the colors, but also by naming the buttons and using symbols that clearly represent what they are for. That's why the "Back" button is always shown in the top right section of the page, as it's a pattern that "right goes forward, left goes back" on web pages and even books, for example. Also, even though the "Login" button cannot be placed in the right part of the header due to the flow, as everyone expects, the "Logout" button can be found there.
